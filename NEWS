Version 1.1.0   5.Jun.2007

* Remove tamer::fileio and tamer::at_fd_close in favor of a tamer::fd
  object with a better interface.

* Language improvements: Add "twait volatile { }" blocks.  Add name
  mangling to closure names, allowing tamed overloaded functions.  Allow
  tvars{} variable initialization with "type var = value".

* Add support for a libevent back end.  When this back end is used, Tamer
  functions like tamer::at_fd_read() compile into libevent "struct event"s,
  and the Tamer driver is a wrapper for libevent's driver.  To use the
  Tamer native driver, set the TAMER_NOLIBEVENT environment variable.

* Add tamer::fun_event(), which wraps a function or function object in an
  event.

* Add event<T*>::canceler() and event<T*>::at_complete().

* Bug fixes in tamer::mutex, tamer::at_time, tamer::with_timeout.

* Include #defines for version numbers.

* "make clean" fixes from Henrik Nordstrom.
